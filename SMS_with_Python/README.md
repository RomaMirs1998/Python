# Twilio SMS Sender

A simple Python script to send SMS messages using the Twilio API.

## Features:
- Send SMS messages with a customizable body.
- Utilizes the Twilio Python client to send messages.
- Prints the session ID (`sid`) for the sent message, which can be used for tracking and verification.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `twilio` Python module (install via pip: `pip install twilio`)
- A Twilio account with a valid Account SID and Auth Token.
- A Twilio phone number to send messages from.

## Setup:

- Ensure you have the `twilio` module installed.
- Replace the placeholder values in the script for `account_sid` and `auth_token` with your actual Twilio Account SID and Auth Token.
- Update the `from_` value with your Twilio phone number and the `to` value with the recipient's phone number.

## Usage:

Run the script to send the SMS:

python sms.py

markdown


Once the message is sent, the script will print the `sid` (session ID) of the message, which is a unique identifier for that message.

## Notes:
- Always store your `account_sid` and `auth_token` securely. Avoid hardcoding them directly in scripts or sharing them publicly.
- Ensure you have sufficient Twilio credits to send messages.
- Message rates may apply based on your Twilio plan and the recipient's location.
