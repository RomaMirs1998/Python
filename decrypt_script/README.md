# Cryptanalysis & Geocaching Project

This project involves tasks related to cryptanalysis and geocaching. The main objectives are to decrypt a provided ciphertext and solve a geocaching riddle.

## Exercise 1.1: Basic Cryptanalysis in Practice

### Objective:
Decrypt the provided ciphertext and restore the corresponding plaintext.

### Requirements:
    1. The deciphered text and the corresponding key.
    2. A step-by-step guide detailing how the cipher was cracked.
    3. If applicable, any created source code, statistical analysis, etc.

### Notes:
- All plaintexts are written in either English or German language.
- All ciphers are monoalphabetic.
- External online services for automated cracking or frequency analysis are prohibited.

## Exercise 1.2: Geocaching

### Objective:
Solve the riddle related to the Mystery Geocache provided in the exercise.

### Instructions:
    1. Visit the geocaching link: [GC6F9YR - MiniFindling](https://coord.info/GC6F9YR).
    2. Read the listing and solve the riddle.
    3. Use [geocheck.org](https://geocheck.org) to verify the answer.
    4. Optionally, visit the actual cache location, take a photo, and log your visit for an additional benefit.

### Notes:
- Registration on [geocaching.com](https://geocaching.com) is free, but it's not mandatory for solving the riddle.
