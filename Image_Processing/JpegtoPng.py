# EXERCISE: IMAGE CONVERSION
# Goal: Write a script that converts all images in a specified directory
# from their current format to PNG and saves them in another directory.

# TIP: Use the PIL library from Pillow for image operations.
# You should obtain the source directory and destination directory from command line arguments.

# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

# Step 2: Ensure the script is being run as the main program

# Step 3: Get the command line arguments
# Hint: The script should be run as: script_name.py source_directory destination_directory
# Make sure to retrieve the source directory (where the images to be converted are located) and
# the destination directory (where the converted images should be saved) from the command line arguments.

# Step 4: Check if the destination directory exists, if not, create it

# Step 5: Loop through each file in the source directory

# Step 5a: Open the image using PIL

# Step 5b: Convert the image to RGB format (this ensures it's compatible with the PNG format)

# Step 5c: Save the image with a PNG extension in the destination directory

# Step 5d: Print a message indicating the conversion was successful for each image

# Step 6: Print a message once all images are converted
